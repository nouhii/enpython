# EnPython
A module that extends Python by adding things like sorting algortihms, converters, etc.

## How to use
Move the downloaded file to the same directory your python program is in. Then, in your program, add "import enpython" at the top.

## Disclaimer
I am relatively new to Python and I am just posting this for fun. My code has many flaws of course but I hope that it might still help some people.
